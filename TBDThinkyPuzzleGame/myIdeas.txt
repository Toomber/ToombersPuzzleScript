Blocks that are destroyed when you jump on them - need to destroy them all? - need to have been falling for multiple blocks to destroy them ("start of fall" object)
-makes jumping more useful
-does the force carry through stacks of blocks?


2 wide elevators ---- "n" wide?
Pulley elevators? - been done before
Blocks that bounce back up after you flatten them.


Bugs: block and player trying to move into same square - give side mover priority?

-yellow blocks falling into exit: If going down, prevent movement instead of cancelling turn.


level idea( push block off exit so it can be used to destroy destructible block)
